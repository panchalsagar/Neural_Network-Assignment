# Problem 1

* PREDICT THE BURNED AREA OF FOREST FIRES WITH NEURAL NETWORKS


# Problem 2


The dataset contains 36733 instances of 11 sensor measures aggregated over one hour (by means of average or sum) from a gas turbine. 

The Dataset includes gas turbine parameters (such as Turbine Inlet Temperature and Compressor Discharge pressure) in addition to the ambient variables.

Problem statement: predicting turbine energy yield (TEY) using ambient variables as features.
